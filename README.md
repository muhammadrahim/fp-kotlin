# fp-kotlin
Learning FP in detail with Kotlin and Arrow.kt (potentially).

Currently, this library has a `Tree` and `LinkedList` data structure. An `Option` data type has also been added for better error-handling.

There is a lot of relevant methods already existing in these classes that I have created.
